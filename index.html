    I am a 5<sup>th</sup>-year Ph.D. candidate at Quantum Theory Project, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida. 
    My interest lies in studying chemistry through the behavior of electrons around nuclei. Currently, I am working on developing electronic wavefunctions to approximate 
    the mysterious problem of strong electronic correlation. I find simulations of chemical systems using quantum computers more appealing. Along with the Ph.D. routine
    life, I enjoy reading and biking. Cooking and serving are a part of my hobby.
