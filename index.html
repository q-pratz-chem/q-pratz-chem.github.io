 <font size="+1">I am a 3<sup>rd</sup>-year graduate student enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Quantum Theory Project, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida. 
My interest lies in studying the chemistry through behavior of electrons around nuclei. Currently, I am working on developing electronic wavefunctions to approximate 
the mysterious problem of strong electronic correlation. I find the simulations of chemical systems using quantum computers more appealing. Along with the Ph.D. routine
life, I enjoy biking and reading. Cooking and serving is part of my hobby. </font>
