I am currently enrolled in the University of Florida as a graduate student for the Ph.D. program in Quantum Theory Project, Department of Chemistry. My interest area is Many Electron Theory and Computational Chemistry, in which I would like to build up future. I would like to work on the interface of Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Computing. I'm also interested in Management. Cooking and serving is part of my hobby.
